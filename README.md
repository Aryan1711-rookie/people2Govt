A good README file for this project would introduce the platform, highlight its key features (especially the AI/ML enhancements), and provide instructions for setting it up locally. Here's a comprehensive README you can use for your GitHub repository.

# people2Govt

**people2Govt** is a mobile-first, crowdsourced platform designed to streamline civic issue reporting and resolution. It aims to bridge the communication gap between citizens and their local government by providing an efficient, transparent, and AI-powered system for managing urban challenges. This project was developed as a solution to enhance civic engagement and government accountability.

## Key Features

  * **Mobile-First Reporting:** Citizens can easily submit reports using an intuitive interface, including photo uploads, automatic geo-location, and both text and voice descriptions.
  * **Intelligent Automation (AI/ML):**
      * **AI-Powered Image Classification:** The system automatically identifies the type of issue (e.g., "pothole," "trash overflow") from an uploaded photo and routes it to the correct department.
      * **Priority Prediction:** A machine learning model analyzes reports to score the urgency of each issue, ensuring critical problems are addressed first.
      * **Voice-to-Text & Translation:** Allows citizens to report in local dialects, making the platform accessible to a wider demographic.
      * **Fraud Detection:** An algorithm flags duplicate or spam reports to maintain the integrity of the system.
  * **Centralized Administrative Dashboard:** Municipal staff can view all reported issues on a live, interactive map, filter reports by category or status, and track departmental performance metrics.
  * **Accountability & Transparency:** The platform offers analytics and reporting features that provide insights into response times and overall system effectiveness, fostering trust between the community and the government.
