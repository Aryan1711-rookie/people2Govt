people2Govt is a crowdsourced civic issue reporting and resolution system designed to connect citizens with their local government. This mobile-first solution addresses the challenge of identifying and resolving everyday problems like potholes and broken streetlights. Citizens can submit real-time reports with photos, location tags, and voice notes. On the administrative side, a centralized dashboard features a live, interactive map, allowing municipal staff to view, filter, and categorize incoming reports.



Our system leverages artificial intelligence to enhance efficiency and accountability. An AI-powered image classifier automatically tags issues (e.g., "sanitation," "public works") from citizen-uploaded photos, which enables automated routing to the correct department. We also incorporate AI for voice-to-text translation, allowing reports in local dialects. Furthermore, a machine learning model predicts issue urgency, helping staff prioritize critical repairs, and a fraud detection system flags spam or duplicate reports. This scalable and resilient platform provides real-time updates and analytics, ultimately promoting greater civic engagement and government transparency.
